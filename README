cuckoo-sig
Written by Joseph Lenox

Straightforward implementation of a signature-based cuckoo hashtable (with a stash) under the
maximum keysize restriction of an unsigned long long int (which is true under
Fermi). 

The primary use case here is where the key is also valuable data in and of itself.

In this system, the value is a reference to some external array, and the key is
a simple hash of the key parts. We use 3-part keys because that's what the
client application that this was written for wants.  Generalization for any
number of key arguments is left as an exercise for other users. :D

The number of hash functions is also fixed to 5. Getting this to also be
generic and still compile down to decent code is also an exercise for the
reader. 

Pattern here is a singleton pattern. Each table should have its own key
arrays, but could share hash functions.

For decent insert performance, make sure that the key arrays are 2/3rds the
size of the actual hashtable. The stash shouldn't be any bigger than 100
entries, as a serial loop is used to check the hash (imposing a penalty
for not-found responses).

For CUDA, the user is expected to ensure that all pointers are legit.

This implementation uses hemi, this will be better-exploited later.

Some other assumptions: 

I assume that there aren't many threads available to parallelize operations
this low. I have some crazy ideas involving a switch to "hijack" threads to
help with rebuilds.


SigCache is a separate class, derived from CuckooSignatureTable that acts as a
cache, evicting old values when the insert "fails". It can be initialized as a
shadow copy of of a CuckooSignatureTable, referencing the same key arrays.
